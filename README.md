## How to Use This Repo

Each project is independently versioned and documented. This index helps:

* Navigate subprojects by focus area
* Discover build details, schematics, and YAML examples
* Track development status (e.g., live, planned, in-testing)

> Contributions, forks, or feedback welcome.

## üõ°Ô∏è Monetization & Source Control Strategy

Some projects in this collection may evolve into monetized or semi-commercial offerings. To balance transparency and control:

### Public Repos Include:

* Compiled YAML examples (no sensitive config)
* STL file previews or printable versions (not editable source)
* Output wiring diagrams (not source schematics)
* Partial documentation for DIY builds

### Private Assets (Held for Future Release or Sale):

* Full Fusion 360 files (`*.f3d`)
* Editable PCB designs and Gerbers
* YAML configuration templates with advanced logic
* Internal BOMs, pricing data, and scripts

### Licensing:

* Projects may be released under a restrictive open license (e.g. CC BY-NC 4.0)
* Source files marked as proprietary are not to be redistributed or resold without permission

### Distribution Options:

* STL/PCB access via Gumroad, Ko-fi, or GitHub Sponsors
* Kit hardware made available through Tindie or Etsy

This strategy preserves flexibility for open collaboration while allowing for commercial exploration in the future.
